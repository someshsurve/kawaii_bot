Thank you for assigning me this wonderful project.
It has been an enlightening experience delving into the process of developing a Discord bot.
Throughout the development of this bot, I encountered various challenges, primarily related to the Discord.py library.
One significant issue I faced was the lack of comprehensive documentation for the library.
Many method explanations were outdated, which required extensive research and experimentation
to adapt the code to the latest version.

Despite these challenges, I remained focused on creating a user-friendly bot.
I strived to simplify its usage by avoiding unnecessary complexities and streamlining the steps required
to interact with the bot. My aim was to ensure that anyone, regardless of their technical expertise,
could easily navigate and utilize the bot's functionalities.

In conclusion, this project has not only enhanced my understanding of Discord bot development but has also
highlighted the importance of thorough documentation in libraries.
I am grateful for the opportunity to tackle these obstacles and create a bot that is accessible and user-friendly.
Thank you once again for entrusting me with this assignment.
